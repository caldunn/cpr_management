\paragraph{}
This document is to outline 2 possible solutions that I am able to offer for the \emph{CPR Service Application}.
It does not go into depth about discussed topics, but I am happy to discuss the solutions in more detail at request.

\paragraph{Security Fixes and Recommendations}
The first section consists of outlining the current security vulnerabilities and the possible solutions to implement into the current application.
It discusses the issues with the application itself alongside ancillary issues with the server itself.

\paragraph{Complete Software Package}
The second section contains a brief introduction of the technologies proposed for the application re-write and why they have been chosen.
It also describes the advantages that are possible by adapting the entire software stack.
