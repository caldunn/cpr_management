\paragraph{}
This document is to outline 2 possible solutions that I am able to offer for the \emph{CPR Service Application}.
It does not go into depth about discussed topics, but I am happy to discuss the solutions in more detail at request.

\paragraph{Security Fixes and Recommendations}
Section 2 consists of outlining the current security vulnerabilities and the possible solutions to implement into the current application.
It discusses the issues with the application itself alongside ancillary issues with the server itself.

\paragraph{Complete Software Package}
Section 3 contains the proposal for an entire application re-write.
It discusses core requirements for the application with introductions to the technologies that will fulfil the core requirements.
There is also some light comparison between the existing application and the security fix option.
